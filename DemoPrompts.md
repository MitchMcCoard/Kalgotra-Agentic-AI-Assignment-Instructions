This is a list of prompts to use for the demo walkthrough
# Prompts
Who knows about chat GPT? Uses it daily?
Anyone heard about Agent mode? What does that mean?
Enabling the AI (LLM) to act on your behalf. That is, to do things. Think of it as giving it acces to functinos.
We call these functinos tools.
Let's take a tour of some tools built in KNIME.
- Read in Data
- Summary Statistics
- Glimpse the data
- Missing category imputation
1. `Hey, can you read in the dataset at "C:\Users\mgm0214\Downloads\Kalgotra_Working_AI_Dataset.xlsx"`
2. `Awesome work! Based on the dataset available and the crisp-dm framework, what are some good next steps?`
3. `Cool. Let's start with a missing-value audit and some summary statistics on dataset 0`
7. `Good work! Go ahead and run the AI-Categorization tool.`
This is an intelligent tool. Meaning, like the imputation tool earlier, this tool uses within it a differe LLM.
When might this be useful? Let's say you have access to some sensitive data, financial data, healthcare data, anything that gives you a competetive advantage. You can't put that into CHatgpt, or others. But you can run it locally. And that is what we are doing.

9. `This is looking great. Let's go ahead and save out this dataset to "C:\Users\mgm0214\Downloads\testoutput.xlsx"`
10. `And just because I'm interested, what kind of topics were in the apps?`
11. 
9. `Next up lets start modeling. What are the modeling options again?`
10. `Neat, lets try topic modeling with this dataset. When you are finished, save out the dataset to "C:\Users\mgm0214\Downloads\testoutput.xlsx"`


6. `Interesting! Will you validate the date columns and impute missing categories on the same dataset?`
