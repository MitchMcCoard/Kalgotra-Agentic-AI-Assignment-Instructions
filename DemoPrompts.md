1. `Hey, can you read in the dataset at "C:\Users\mgm0214\Downloads\Kalgotra_Working_AI_Dataset.xlsx"`
2. `Awesome work! Based on the dataset available and the crisp-dm framework, what are some good next steps?`
3. `Cool. Let's start with a missing-value audit and some summary statistics on dataset 0`
6. `Interesting! Will you validate the date columns and impute missing categories on the same dataset?`
7. `Good work! Go ahead and run the AI-Categorization tool.`
8. `Next up lets start modeling. What are the modeling options again?`
9. `Neat, lets try topic modeling with this dataset. When you are finished, save out the dataset to "C:\Users\mgm0214\Downloads\testoutput.xlsx"`
